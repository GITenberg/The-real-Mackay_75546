<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The “best room” in a crofter’s cottage in the Scottish
Highlands. To the left a small open window, round which honeysuckle
clings and blooms, affords a glimpse of a blue loch, softly
screened by the drooping branches of a silver birch, and glistening
in bright sunshine. Beside the window Màiri Mackay sits knitting
a white shawl. A folding table, with the leaves down, occupies the
centre of the room and is covered with a Mackay tartan plaid. Upon
it stands a dark blue bowl filled with wild roses. Widow Mackay
sits to the right, at her spinning wheel, between the table and a wide,
open fire-place. Peat smoulders in the grate. To the left of the
fire-place is an “easy chair” (a plain arm-chair with a cushion), and
to the right a nursing chair with short legs; a stool is tilted in front
on a deerskin rug. Against the wall, between the little window and
a bedroom door, is a dark mahogany chest of drawers, on which lies a
bulky family Bible between two gaudy vases. Three chairs are ranged
against the wall to the left, and the floor is covered with flowery waxcloth,
brilliantly new. The walls are adorned with framed portraits
of John Knox, John Bunyan, William Ewart Gladstone, and a Free
Church minister. On the high mantelpiece squat two white porcelain
dogs with black noses, and above it is a set of bagpipes. A “wag-at-the-wa”
clock ticks leisurely to the right of the fireplace.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Early afternoon: a sunny day in late June.</i></p>


<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>stops spinning and looks towards her daughter over her
glasses</i>). You’ll be sitting in a draught, Màiri. Shut the
window or you will maybe catch a cheel<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—you that looks so
delicate.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> Oh! there’s no fear of me, mother. If you won’t be
minding, I would rather have the window open. I love to
breathe the fresh air from the loch. (<i>Takes a deep breath.</i>)
It’s so refreshing after being in a stuffy city, and the honeysuckle
smells so sweet. How quiet it is here; you can listen
to the quietness, so to speak.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Well, well, my treasure, have your own way with it.
Balree is indeed a sweet place, and God’s world is very beautiful.
(<i>Stops spinning.</i>) Màiri, that honeysuckle was planted out
there by your dear father, nineteen years ago, on the very day
you came into the world. He’ll be at his rest now three
years come Martinmas, and every summer his beautiful
flower will be growing and spreading and blooming. The
smell of it goes to my heart like a sweet thought of him. (<i>Sighs
and resumes her work at the spinning wheel, drawing out a thread
and adjusting it.</i>) It’s your own father that would be proud
of you, Màiri, if he was still with us, but the Lord appointed
otherwise. (<i>Sighs.</i>) His will be done. (<i>Goes on spinning.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>Màiri rises from her chair, draws a tendril of honeysuckle through
the window and smells it: then she plucks a blossom and puts
it in her blouse. Musing, she leans her elbow on the window,
chin on hand, gazing towards the loch. Her mother stops spinning,
looks up and watches her daughter for a few seconds in silence.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> You are very quiet, Màiri. How you have changed!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> I was only thinking to myself—just thinking a little.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> It’s me that sees a great difference in you—you that used
to be such a cheery lassie, always laughing and teasing one
and making the jokes. Many times, when you’re away, I
will be smiling here my lone self, thinking o’ the things you
used to be saying and doing. Now, I’ll notice, and I canna’
help noticing it, that you’re changed so much. I suppose it’s
the city that does it. You’ll have many things, no doubt,
to be thinking over, and maybe, yes, maybe, you’re feeling
just a little dull, now, in this quiet place.... You’ll often
be sitting thinking to yourself in that way. Surely nosing<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
will be troubling you, m’eudail<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>?</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>Màiri does not answer. She sits down, hangs her head and resumes
knitting. Her mother rises, grasping her chin between her
fingers, a look of concern on her face; goes over to the window
and sits besides her daughter.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> And something is troubling you, Màiri, my own. You
canna’ hide it from me. There will be tears in your eyes,
Ochone! what will you be hiding in the deep heart of you?
You shouldn’t be hiding anysing at all, at all, from me, your
own mother.</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>Màiri shakes her head, takes out her handkerchief and dries her
eyes.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>very softly</i>). You are all I have left in this world—your
father dead, your brother killed in the war in a foreign
land far away. It would break my heart to think you would
be keeping anysing from me. What is it? Tell me (<i>strokes
the girl’s hair</i>), dove of my heart! my fair love!... Màiri
(<i>entreatingly</i>).</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri</span> (<i>resuming her knitting</i>). It was only a foolish thought
(<i>pause</i>)—a thought about one I shouldn’t maybe be thinking
of, now that I’m here.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Ah! has he—has <i>he</i> ... turned false to you, now?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Well, not what you would call false, not that
altogether.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> A lovers’ quarrel, no doubt. You’re young, you’re young,
but the young heart can feel sore. I mind well. I was
once like you, Màiri. Your father and I had once a lover’s
quarrel. But it came all right. Lovers’ quarrels are sometimes
sweet to remember afterwards.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> It’s not what you would call a quarrel either. But we’ve
parted—parted for ever. But don’t be worrying, mother,
I’ll maybe no’ be caring so much as you would think.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Well, well, it’s the way of the world. Maybe you’ll
change your mind yet. Maybe you wass just a little bit to
blame yourself, now, eh? I wouldn’t say you wass, Màiri,
no, no. But girls—bonnie girls like yourself, my dove, will
sometimes be doing things and saying things they’ll no’ quite
intend altogether, and then they’ll be thinking afterwards
that it’s maybe a pity it wasn’t otherwise.... Is he a good
lad, Màiri, steady at his work, no drinking, and always attending
the church? Is he what you would call handsome, now,—big
and manly like your father?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri</span> (<i>smiling</i>). No doubt he would have pleased you. If looks
were everything, you’d be quite satisfied. He’s a gentleman
in every way.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> A Highland lad, too, maybe, and of a good clan?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> Well, no’ exactly what you would call Highland; but
his grandfather was a Ross and he’s proud of it.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> So well he might be. There were some fine Rosses,
although they were never like the Mackays, or my own clan,
the great clan Donald. I would like to see your young man,
Màiri. You’ll make it up all right with him yet, eh?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> No, no; it’s all past. He’s fickle, mother—a poppy in
the corn—a butterfly—one you would maybe like to look at,
but not to depend on—changeable as the wind, and cruel
without knowing it—aye! (<i>Sighs.</i>) But don’t be speaking
about him. It’s time I was beginning to forget there’s such
a one in the world.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Aye, so.... (<i>Looking through the window</i>). There’s
Sandy coming.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri</span> (<i>rising quickly in alarm</i>). Who—who?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> It’s only Sandy, oor neighbour. He’s coming to sow the
turnips for me. Ah! Màiri, the neighbours will be very good
to me since your father’s death. Every one of them comes to
do his share o’ work on the croft and keep a roof above my
head. I’ll better be speaking to Sandy. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> Sandy.... Why should I have thought it was him?
He does not know where I live, and, besides, he wouldn’t come
if he knew, except maybe to wound my heart deeper without
knowing what he was doing.... Why did I tell mother? I
can’t explain everything to her. She cannot understand.
Did Sandy’s mother not tell me that he is not in my station
of life, and that she would be disgraced if he married a servant—a
servant in his mother’s house. Oh! it’s her that wounded
my pride—her thinking she was better than me! a shopkeeper’s
wife (as if that were something great) and me a real
Mackay, with lords and bards and great chiefs in my line....
Oh! if I only had the money, she wouldn’t despise me so.
But what’s money? Money will not make one a lady.... I
must forget, forget what was—forget Sandy and his mother
and the rest.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>enters</i>). Sandy was asking when you will be going away.
(<i>Sighs.</i>) I said I wasn’t very sure. He’s wondering you haven’t
been down to see his wife who was so ill last winter. Haste
you, my dear, and be calling on her at once. She has been
a good kind friend to me, Màiri.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> I’ll go down just now, mother. But don’t be speaking about
me going away. (<i>Smiles.</i>) I have made up my mind to stay
here with you always after this. You’re getting old and
canna’ be left alone.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I wish you could aye be here, as you say. (<i>Sighs.</i>) But
we’re too poor, Màiri. It canna’ be. We must bear our
burdens in this world though our hearts should be breaking.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> I have a plan, mother, that will bring us money, and I’m
going to give you a little surprise.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> How can you make money here, lassie? Now, tell me
that.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> Keeping visitors. Letting the house. I’ve thought of
it for a long time, and that’s why I brought you things for the
house—the waxcloth, the new blankets, and the rest.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>amazed</i>). Keeping veesitors?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> I saw how it was done last summer when we were holidaying
near Oban. Oh! the people in the west are clever at making
the money in the summer.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Don’t tell me they’re cleverer in the west than in the north.
Who ever heard of such a thing? They haven’t such land
as our land.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> I know a widow near Oban—a Macdougall she is. Her
son has a bicycle and her daughter has a piano. The croft is
a poorer croft than our croft, and they have a slated roof,
a porch at the door, registered grates, water taps in the kitchen,
and a carpet in the best room.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> How did they manage it?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> The visitors, of course.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> The veesitors!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> Ailie Macdougall is a nice girl, and she hasn’t to go to
service the whole year round like me. You see, they get so
much money from the visitors that it keeps them and pays
the rent.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I’m sure it’s very good of the veesitors. But, Màiri, I
wouldn’t be beholden to anybody. I wouldn’t take charity
money, although I’m a poor widow, from any stranger,
man or woman, however grand. No, no I couldn’t think
of it.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> You don’t understand. The money is payment for rent
and attendance. We’ll let the house to visitors or take in
lodgers, and charge maybe £12 a month with attendance.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> But we canna’ afford to slate the roof and get a piano and
all the rest. You couldn’t ask gentry to stay here, Màiri.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> You’re wrong there, mother. It’s fashionable for the city
gentry to be staying now for holidays in “crofters’ cottages,”
as they call them. They think houses like this are most
artistic. They’re quite right too. This is a finer house
than any in a city—not so grand, of course, but more sweet
and homely in every way. The gentry are beginning to know
that. Oh! mother, you would be surprised to see how they
imitate us.... In the house where I was serving they had
a spinning wheel and a three-legged pot in the drawing-room,
cruisies in the dining-room, horn spoons and wooden ladles,
and old plates and bowls here and there and everywhere as
ornaments. They will pay a lot of money for things we will
just be throwing away.... Maybe they’ll buy the old bagpipes.
(<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> My grandfather’s bagpipes—the bagpipes of a Gaelic
bard? No, no; I’d sooner starve than part with a thing in
this house. Everything is covered with memories of my
heart.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> I spoke to the Postmaster about letting the house. I
wanted to give you a surprise.... I’ll better be going to see
Sandy’s wife. Now, mother, if the visitors call when I’m
out, you’ll keep them speaking till I return. Don’t take the
first offer. Ask the highest terms you can. (<i>Draws a knitted
shawl over her head.</i>) Now I’ll be off.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Will you not be putting on your feather hat and your
Sunday costume? The like o’ that hat is no’ to be seen in the
glen.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> The shawl is sweeter. If I put on my best hat, people
would think I was getting too proud. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>sits at spinning wheel</i>). It’s a queer notion the lassie
will have got into her head. But I must humour her. And
so she’s got a lad; and him and her have had a cast out.
Poor lass! That’ll no’ last long. Blessings be on the dear
heart of her! Any lad <i>my</i> Màiri would keep company with
must be a good lad, and any lad that once set his eyes on <i>my</i>
Màiri will no’ be wanting to lose her. The treasure!... It’s
myself would be thankful to see her married decently and
well.... I’m getting old, as her dear self would be saying.
(<i>Sighs.</i>) My time will no’ be long now.</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>Enter Mrs Speedwell, attired in summer costume. Of middle age.
Has come from Edinburgh and is staying at the village hotel,
a mile distant from Balree Croft. Looks at the widow, who is
spinning.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> (<i>aside</i>). What a charming picture! How Sandy would
love to paint her! This is the very house for Sandy....
(<i>Aloud</i>) Good afternoon, Mrs Mackay (<i>smiles</i>)—you’re Mrs
Mackay?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Pardon me, mem, I wass busy, and wouldn’t be seeing you.
Would you kindly sit down?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> Thank you. (<i>Sits down.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Will you be feeling the draught? I’ll—I’ll shut the
window.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> (<i>aside</i>). A charming woman. (<i>Aloud.</i>) No thank you.
The air is so delicately fresh here. This is a delightful district,
Mrs Mackay.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> It is very kind of you to be saying that. Balree has
been my home for five and twenty years. When my man
took me here I thought it the sweetest place on earth,
next to my own glen, of course, and I’ll be content to end my
days in his house, the Lord willing.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> The Postmaster tells me you have rooms to let. My son
is anxious to stay in the country, and I think your cottage will
suit him. He doesn’t know I am here; the Postmaster wired
to him yesterday saying he could get suitable rooms. My son
wants to work in the Highlands during the summer and
autumn.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> To work here? Well (<i>pause</i>), it’s not easy to find work
here. What will his business be?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh! he’s a painter.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Indeet! Well, (<i>pause</i>) he will not get very much
painting to do in this poor place, unless, maybe, of course,
at the shooting lodge, but I’m afraid that it was painted in
the spring.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> (<i>laughing</i>). He’s not a house painter, but an artist. He
paints pictures, you understand.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Oh! yes, yes; I see, I see. I’ll understand.... I’ll be
noticing some gentlemen drawing wonderful pictures here
about in the summer, and some ladies also. And very clever
they are, too. It’s a gift—yes, a great gift, just like making
songs and playing the pipes.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> My son makes songs too—he’s a poet, you know; not
that I can understand his poetry; it’s all Greek to me, but it
amuses him, and that’s everything.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> He must be very clever. My grandfather was a fine poet.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh! really. Sandy will be delighted. He’ll be sure to
buy a copy of your grandfather’s book.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> There is no book: his songs were never put in a book,
but everybody sings them from Reay to Lochaber.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> How interesting! I’m sure you will be very friendly
with my son. Perhaps you will make more of him than I can.
His manner is irritating to me, and we’re not very good friends
at present.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I hope he’s no’ taking the drink.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> Oh, no! but the poor boy has a temperament.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> A bad temper?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> No, he’s not bad tempered, but very moody, inclined to be
melancholy at times. And he’s so unconventional. He wants
to return to Nature, he says, and in trying to be natural he
has grown quite eccentric. He’s not like an ordinary city man
at all.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Gentlemen are often strange in their ways. They have
so little to do that they cannot help taking queer notions.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Perhaps. He’s tiresome at home but he’s
absolutely unbearable on a holiday; he won’t even dress
himself decently. He makes one climb dreadful hills to see
the sun setting or the moon rising, and is continually drawing
one’s attention to the light falling here and there. He’s in
love with Nature, of course.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> With whom did you say?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> He’s in love with the country, the fine scenery, and so on.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> And why for no?... God’s beautiful world.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> I admire the country very much in the summer. It’s so
restful and sets one up so. But I can’t understand how you
exist during the winter season in this solitary place.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> It’s as beautiful in winter as in summer. Many times I
will be looking through the window there to see the moon
rising over the loch on a winter’s night when the ground is
white and sparkling and all the world is at peace. It is like
a dream of Heaven.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> You have an eye for the beautiful, Mrs Mackay; but you
don’t always get moonlight nights and clear days in the winter.
(<i>Shrugging her shoulders.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Every day is different and every day has its own beauty,
mem.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> You will get on splendidly with my son. I’m so glad I
have come here. You set my mind at ease. I can quite see
you will have a strong influence over him. So I had better
let you into my little secret, and perhaps you will help me.
My son is in love, Mrs Mackay, terribly in love. At least
he thinks he is.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Indeet!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> I shouldn’t mind that so much. But he is in love with a
girl far below him in rank. It worries me very much.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I see.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> (<i>confidentially</i>). Do you know he actually wanted to
marry one of my servants—the tablemaid.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Surely she must be a very attractive girl.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> That’s it. A pretty girl, naturally refined, an excellent
servant, but not a suitable wife for a rich husband. A foolish
marriage would ruin my son’s social prospects. I could never
hold up my head again if such a thing happened. So I had
to put my foot down. I sent the girl away and told her my
son had asked me to do so, but I told my son the girl had left
of her own accord to free herself of his undesired attentions.
It was a terrible thing to have to do.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> A very terrible thing, indeet, to be telling what was maybe
not true.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> Yes, it cost me a pang or two of conscience, but I knew
it was for the best. The poor boy has suffered, but, as his
sister says, he is recovering slowly. A spell of hard work
will do him a lot of good. I hope you will help me by encouraging
him to work, Mrs Mackay. Praise his work and keep
him at it. Tell him he is improving every day. He likes to be
praised. All artists and poets do; they live on praise or the
hope of praise. They prefer praise to money, poor fellows.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> There are more desirable things in this world than
money; all we require of it is just a little for our daily needs.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> Which vary, of course. I hope you’ll do your best to help
me, Mrs Mackay. I feel I can trust you.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> If I can do anything to help you, I’ll do it, I’m sure.
But it’s little I can talk to him about, I’m afraid.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Discuss his soul with him. He is great on his
soul.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I’m glad to hear that, mem, yes, I am indeet. I’ll speak
to our new minister about him; he’s a very earnest lad.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> I don’t quite mean that. When my son speaks about his
soul, he means his artistic impulses or his affections, or, perhaps,
his affectations. For instance, when he is painting a picture,
he talks about painting his soul. He says his poetry is full of
soul. And, do you know, he called that servant girl “the
companion of his soul.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>sighs</i>). Ochone! It’s a terrible way to be speaking about
his eternal soul. (<i>Rocks herself with clasped hands.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> Yes, rather absurd, isn’t it? We old-fashioned people
keep our souls for our religious life, of course; for the church,
not for the studio. But do not heed his little ways and his
absurd remarks. Humour him and flatter him judiciously.
That’s what I always do. (<i>Rises.</i>) I think I’ll walk to the station
to meet him. He’ll get a surprise to see me here. I want to be
reconciled to the dear boy before I go on holiday myself. How
far is it to the station, Mrs Mackay?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> It’s two miles round by the road, but there’s a short cut
across the moor. (<i>Looking through the window.</i>) If you will
ask the postman, who is just coming, to show you the way,
he’ll put you right. It’s just a little over half a mile to the
station by the short cut.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> Thank you so much. Good evening, Mrs Mackay. I’ll
see you later on. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> A nice lady, but one that’s needing to be spoken to very
seriously about her own soul. I wonder what sort o’ minister
she’ll be sitting under. She’s no’ afraid to be telling lies to
her son and her servant for fear they will get married, and
maybe they’ll be very fond of one another. It’s doing the
devil’s work to come between young people in love; and if
they’re meant for one another it’s no’ her or anybody else will
keep them apart.... I wonder what Màiri will say when I
tell her.... And, oh! dear me, Màiri will not be pleased
with me. I never said a word about money. I never thought
on such a thing. And worst of all, I never asked the lady
her name. Am I no’ the stupid one?</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>Motor horn sounds in the distance.</i>]</p>

<p class="indent3">I wonder who that will be. The doctor, very likely. Somebody
must be ill. (<i>Looking through the window.</i>) It’s no’ the doctor,
but a strange gentleman coming this way. It canna’ be the
lady’s son, for he’s coming by train. This will be another
veesitor, but he’s too late. I wish Màiri was here. I’m no’
fit to be speaking to the veesitors.</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>Enter Sandy Speedwell.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Good day to you, sir, I’m ferry glad to see you, indeet.
Will you be taking a chair?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> I’m your lodger, Mrs Mackay. I had a wire from the
Postmaster and motored here with a friend. This is a
beautiful glen.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I hope there’s no mistake. Will you be the gentleman
who is a painter and a poet too?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Really you surprise me, madam. What
little bird has been carrying tales about me? I thought I
had reached the back of the world.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> A lady called here, sir, and was telling me. <span class="lock">But——</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> A lady? What lady? (<i>Anxiously.</i>) Your niece, your
daughter, your cousin—who is she, what is she? A young lady
or an old lady?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>smiling</i>). No relation of mine, sir. You’ll soon be
seeing her yourself. Maybe I’ll better go and tell her you
are here. She’s neither young nor old, but somesing between
the two. (<i>Aside.</i>) I musn’t be telling him it was his own mother.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> No, don’t go. I’m in no mood to meet any of my acquaintances.
(<i>Aside.</i>) Those prying gossips! One can’t go a
step for them. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I prefer to talk to yourself, Mrs
Mackay, but I must ask you to do me a special favour.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I’m at your service, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> <i>Don’t</i> call me “sir.” My name is Sandy.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Indeet. A very homely name indeet, <i>sir</i>—I beg your
pardon—there will be one or two Sandys in this same glen
already.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> Splendid! I’ll be able to hide myself. If anybody calls
here asking for Sandy, you’ll send them to some other Sandy....
(<i>Gazes steadfastly at Mrs Mackay.</i>) Look through the
window, Mrs Mackay.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). What is it?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> Sit down, please, don’t move. You make an excellent
picture. Just look towards the window. (<i>Widow looks
nervously.</i>) Ah! wonderful; she was Spring, you are late
September. (<i>Sighs.</i>) I must paint you.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Paint me?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> I will paint your portrait and present it to you afterwards.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>aside</i>). Màiri said the veesitors were so kind to people.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) That’s very good of you, <span class="lock">Mr——</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> Sandy.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Mr Sandy.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> No, simply Sandy. (<i>Laughs.</i>) Simple Sandy, if you like,
or just Sandy.</p>

<p class="hanging">Widow (<i>aside</i>). So simple and plain; he must be a born gentleman.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I’ll be trying to remember. (<i>Smiles.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>musingly</i>). What is there in you Highland people that
makes you seem all alike, I wonder? When you smile, you
remind me of—of someone I knew. A Highland lady also.
(<i>Aside.</i>) Ah! dear me, can I never get her out of my mind?—Màiri,
Màiri, my soul calls you. You haunt me night and
day. (<i>Aloud.</i>) This is a very beautiful little house. What a
rare window! And this fire-place! (<i>Sits down on a
stool.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> Take the easy chair, if you please. I’m sure you’re
feeling tired.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> Is that your most comfortable chair, Mrs Mackay?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). Yes, it will be, but maybe by next <span class="lock">year——</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> Then come and sit in it, please, and speak to me. I’m
dull, madam. (<i>Sighs.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>pokes up the peat</i>). It’s a poor fire, indeet, and there’s
nothing so cheery as a bright fire. I hope you’ll be excusing
the old fire-place, but maybe by next year we’ll have a
registered grate. (<i>Sits down.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> (<i>standing up</i>). Heavens! don’t speak about such a thing,
never think of changing your grate. It’s perfect, madam.
(<i>Smiles.</i>) I must paint this fire-place, and you must sit beside
it at your spinning wheel. (<i>Glances round the room.</i>) I will
give you some pictures to hide those on the wall—those
frowning fellows—pah!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>aside</i>). I must mind to be humouring him. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
You are too kind, indeet. But first I will give you something
to eat. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> Sit down, Mrs Mackay. I’m not hungry. Please do not
go away. (<i>Gazes in her face.</i>) Do sit down. (<i>Aside.</i>) How
like Màiri she is. I seem to see Màiri everywhere, yet I
cannot see her.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> I’m afraid you’ll have to be excusing me. I have to go
for a little message, but I’ll not be long. I’m sure you will
be excusing me, now.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> I beg your pardon, Mrs Mackay. It’s selfish of me to
detain you.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Widow</span> (<i>smiling.</i>) I’ll soon be back. (<i>Aside.</i>) I must hurry after
his mother and tell her. The poor lad is eating out his heart
because he has quarrelled with her. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Be amusing
yourself till I return, Mr Sandy—I mean Sandy. (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ll
better hurry and get back before Màiri comes. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>Alone. Sits before the fire on the low stool. Elbows on
knees and face between his hands.</i>) I cannot escape Màiri.
Everywhere I go I think of Màiri. (<i>Takes a sheet of notepaper

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri</span> (<i>raising herself stiffly</i>). Well you know whose house you

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> If you ask me to go, I certainly will. But before I do,
let me tell you this, Màiri: I have never asked my mother
to say anything to you about me.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> Perhaps not. But she told me all.... Are you going now?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy</span> (<i>brokenly</i>). Màiri, do not break my heart. Do not spurn
me, as if I were a leper. Oh, Màiri, if you must send me away,
once again, let us part as friends.... Why, oh why, did you
not tell me yourself that you had grown tired of me? Why
did you ask my mother to repeat your cruel words?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Màiri.</span> Your mother? My cruel words? I never gave any

I was broken-hearted, and what I felt most and feel most is
that you never even left a letter for me. If only you had,
I should have been better able to bear it....</p>

you tell your mother to say to me?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sandy.</span> Nothing! I never spoke to her about you after I told
her we were engaged, until that black evening when she seared
my soul with your message—the message she said you left
for me.</p>
